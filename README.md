The goal of this first assignment of the course LT2326 "Machine Learning for Statistical NLP: advanced" is to automatically recognize the text on the car plates. We use this dataset containing pictures of car plates: [License Plate Characters - Detection OCR](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/francescopettini/license-plate-characters-detection-ocr). The code used in this assignment (especially in part 1) is taken from this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Deepayan137/Adapting-OCR) by Deepayan137.
